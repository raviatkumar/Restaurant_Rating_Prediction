# **Restaurant Rating Prediction System**

## **Project Summary**

This project focuses on predicting restaurant ratings using features from the Zomato dataset. The workflow involved several key machine learning processes, including Data Exploration, Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, and Model Building. The insights gathered from thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) were instrumental in building a robust predictive model.

### **Key Insights from EDA**:
- **Online vs. Offline Orders**: Around 30,000 orders were online, while about 23,000 were offline, indicating the popularity of online orders.
- **Preferred Service Type**: Delivery was the most preferred service (50.2%), followed by Dine-out (34.4%).
- **Popular Locations**: Areas such as BTM and Koramangala have the highest number of restaurants.
- **Top Cuisines**: North Indian, Chinese, and South Indian cuisines are the most popular among customers.
- **Restaurant Types**: Quick Bites and Casual Dining were found to be the most common restaurant categories.
- **Cost Preference**: A meal for two costing around â‚¹300 was the most preferred price range, with approximately 7,000 orders in that range.

### **Modeling and Algorithms**:
After the data was cleaned and pre-processed, various regression models were implemented to predict restaurant ratings. The following machine learning models were evaluated:
- **Linear Regression**
- **Decision Tree Regressor**
- **Random Forest Regressor**
- **Gradient Boosting Regressor**
- **XGBoost**
- **XGBoost with Cross-Validation (CV)**

Among these, **XGBoost with Cross-Validation** demonstrated the best performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency. This model was subsequently chosen for deployment. The trained model and label encoders were saved as **pickle files** for use in the Flask application.

## **Tech Stack**

- **Flask**: A lightweight Python framework used for building the web application.
- **Machine Learning**: XGBoost was the primary model used for rating predictions.
- **HTML/CSS**: Used for creating the front-end forms and pages.
- **Pickle**: For saving the machine learning models and encoders.
- **Deployment**: The application runs on **localhost:5000** and can be dockerized for further deployment on cloud platforms.

### **3. Prediction Page**
- Users input various restaurant attributes (e.g., location, online order, cuisine) into the form.
- The Flask backend sends these inputs to the machine learning model, and the predicted rating is displayed.
